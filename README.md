# C HelloWorld

This is a very basic example for getting started with C. This program will output a "Hello World" message.

You will need a c compiler to compile this code. In absense of a traditional compiler I used Visual Studio 2015 and followed the steps here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384838.aspx

## Steps
(Using Visual Studio 2015)

1. Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS2015". This can be found under the Visual Studio 2015 > Visual Studio Tools directory

2. CD to C.HelloWorld

3. cl helloworld.c (cl = compile). You should now have an exe in your directory along with a .obj

4. Cmd Prompt > helloworld. You should now see the message "Hello World".
